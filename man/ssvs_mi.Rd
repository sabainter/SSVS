\title{Perform SSVS on Multiply Imputed Datasets}
\usage{
ssvs_mi(
  data,
  y,
  x,
  imp,
  imp_num = 5,
  interval = 0.9,
  continuous = TRUE,
  progress = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the variables of interest, including an \code{.imp} column for imputation identifiers.}

\item{y}{The response variable (character string).}

\item{x}{A vector of predictor variable names.}

\item{imp}{The imputation variable.}

\item{imp_num}{The number of imputations to process (default is 5).}

\item{interval}{Confidence interval level for summary results (default is 0.9).}

\item{continuous}{If \code{TRUE}, treat the response variable as continuous. If
\code{FALSE}, treat the response variable as binary.}

\item{progress}{Logical indicating whether to display progress (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
An ssvs_mi object containing aggregated results across imputations that can be
used in \code{\link[=summary.ssvs_mi]{summary()}}.
}
\description{
This function performs Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) analysis on multiply imputed datasets
for a given set of predictors and a response variable. It supports continuous response variables and calculates
aggregated results across multiple imputations.
